    <p>Highlands is a huge deathmatch map, with two castles, a cave and more stuff. This map is sponsored by the DeGroot family.
        That is what I <EM>would've</EM> said if they had actually sponsored me (but that would be awesome.)
        <br>
        <br>
        This map is a bit more complex that the other ones, so let me explain what is going on:
        <br>
        The map is broken up into two regions, one is the one with the two castles and the other is the area without
        the castles (shocker). For players from the first area to get to the second, they must walk through through
        the cave. From there, they can get access to the skull switch close to the gray castle, which lowers the door,
        thus connecting the two parts of the map together with easy access. HOWEVER, you can use the other skull switch
        to close the door, thus allowing access only through the cave, which means that you can camp there and frag
        everyone who tries to cross.
        </p>
        <p>
        <br>
        To run the map, drag the zip files to the GZDoom executable.
        Then, set deathmatch to 1 using the command "deathmatch 1".
        <br>

        

        <br>

        Then, run the command "map map01" to load into the map.
