    <h1>2/4/25: Chasm: The Rift - Generic Brand Quake
    </h1>
    <p class="blog">    Chasm is a 1997 FPS that can be best described as Generic Brand Quake. Chasm could also be considered the grandfather of all slavjank.<br>
    Lets get started with the weapons. The weapons in Chasm feel lightweight. VERY lightweight. You start with a pistol that does almost nothing. There is the double barreled shotgun,
    which in reality is just a normal shotgun that fires one shot at a time. There is a rocket launcher, a flaming blade launcher, a BFG knockoff and a couple more.<br>
    
    Lets also talk about the monsters, which are quite generic in the first levels but get increasingly more original as the game goes on. There is a scorpion, a Twitter user (a jester) and more.<br>

    The plot of Chasm is that evil aliens are attacking through time and we must stop them because they are the bad guys. The levels take place throughout different ages, like the
    medieval age, egyptian age and an alien dimension (can't believe Daikatana copied this masterpiece). <br>

    The level design in Chasm is weak. Switches are put in places that will make you not see them and the design in general is boring. Maybe because THE ENGINE FOR CHASM ISN'T 
    3D! After examining the game carefully, you might realise that it is just a Wolfenstein engine with 3D models! And light effects! And 3D models slapped on top of levels WITH 
    NO Y-AXIS. To be honest however, it is slavjank, what did I expect. <br>

    Overall, I rate Chasm a 5.5/10. Not a perfect game by any means, but a fun little time waster for when you are waiting for any better game to finish downloading.
